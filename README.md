# BEWT
BEWT is a similar device as the EWICON device in concept.(I was hoping)
I was trying to recreate that effect but instead of charged water droplets, I would use CO2.
Instead of straight wires, I was trying to use a conical-shaped coil and a wire mesh collector.

This is a Micro-Sized version of what I intended. The purpose of this device is to convert the charged CO2 into Energy and mineralize it. I am not exactly familiar with any of the processes. I have read up on what I could. 

The BEWT would fit to the rear of a car exhaust or any exhaust port that expells CO2 and converts that into an energy source and mineralizes the CO2. 

The images are of the Micro prototype.
